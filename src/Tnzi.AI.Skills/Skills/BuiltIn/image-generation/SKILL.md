# Image Generation Skill

## Overview

This skill generates high-quality images using structured prompts and a generation script. The workflow includes creating JSON-formatted prompts and executing image generation with optional reference images.

## Core Capabilities

- Create structured JSON prompts for AIGC image generation
- Support multiple reference images for style/composition guidance
- Generate images through automated script execution
- Handle various image generation scenarios (character design, scenes, products, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

When a user requests image generation, identify:

- Subject/content: What should be in the image
- Style preferences: Art style, mood, color palette
- Technical specs: Aspect ratio, composition, lighting
- Reference images: Any images to guide generation

### Step 2: Create Structured Prompt

Generate a structured JSON file with naming pattern: `{descriptive-name}.json`

### Step 3: Execute Generation

Call the generation script:
```bash
python scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file /path/to/prompt-file.json \
  --reference-images /path/to/ref1.jpg /path/to/ref2.png \
  --output-file /path/to/outputs/generated-image.jpg \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

Parameters:

- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to JSON prompt file (required)
- `--reference-images`: Absolute paths to reference images (optional, space-separated)
- `--output-file`: Absolute path to output image file (required)
- `--aspect-ratio`: Aspect ratio of the generated image (optional, default: 16:9)

> [!NOTE]
> Do NOT read the script file, just call it with the parameters.

## Character Generation Example

User request: "Create a Tokyo street style woman character in 1990s"

Create prompt file: `asian-woman.json`
```json
{
  "characters": [{
    "gender": "female",
    "age": "mid-20s",
    "ethnicity": "Japanese",
    "body_type": "slender, elegant",
    "facial_features": "delicate features, expressive eyes, subtle makeup with emphasis on lips, long dark hair partially wet from rain",
    "clothing": "stylish trench coat, designer handbag, high heels, contemporary Tokyo street fashion",
    "accessories": "minimal jewelry, statement earrings, leather handbag",
    "era": "1990s"
  }],
  "negative_prompt": "blurry face, deformed, low quality, overly sharp digital look, oversaturated colors, artificial lighting, studio setting, posed, selfie angle",
  "style": "Leica M11 street photography aesthetic, film-like rendering, natural color palette with slight warmth, bokeh background blur, analog photography feel",
  "composition": "medium shot, rule of thirds, subject slightly off-center, environmental context of Tokyo street visible, shallow depth of field isolating subject",
  "lighting": "neon lights from signs and storefronts, wet pavement reflections, soft ambient city glow, natural street lighting, rim lighting from background neons",
  "color_palette": "muted naturalistic tones, warm skin tones, cool blue and magenta neon accents, desaturated compared to digital photography, film grain texture"
}
```

Execute generation:
```bash
python scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file /path/to/workspace/asian-woman.json \
  --output-file /path/to/outputs/tokyo-street-01.jpg \
  --aspect-ratio 2:3
```

## Common Scenarios

Use different JSON schemas for different scenarios.

**Character Design**:
- Physical attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, body type)
- Facial features and expressions
- Clothing and accessories
- Historical era or setting
- Pose and context

**Scene Generation**:
- Environment description
- Time of day, weather
- Mood and atmosphere
- Focal points and composition

**Product Visualization**:
- Product details and materials
- Lighting setup
- Background and context
- Presentation angle

## Output Handling

After generation:

- Share generated images with user
- Provide brief description of the generation result
- Offer to iterate if adjustments needed

## Tips: Enhancing Generation with Reference Images

For scenarios where visual accuracy is critical, **search for reference images first** before generation.

**Recommended scenarios for reference image search:**
- **Character/Portrait Generation**: Search for similar poses, expressions, or styles to guide facial features and body proportions
- **Specific Objects or Products**: Find reference images of real objects to ensure accurate representation
- **Architectural or Environmental Scenes**: Search for location references to capture authentic details
- **Fashion and Clothing**: Find style references to ensure accurate garment details and styling

This approach significantly improves generation quality by providing the model with concrete visual guidance rather than relying solely on text descriptions.

## Notes

- Always use English for prompts regardless of user's language
- JSON format ensures structured, parsable prompts
- Reference images enhance generation quality significantly
- Iterative refinement is normal for optimal results
- For character generation, include the detailed character object plus a consolidated prompt field
